# pomodoro
**ARCHIVED**: I do not plan to work on this project anymore, I do not have neither time nor need for it.

A terminal ~~(for now)~~ app that manages your pomodoro timers.

~~This is a work in progress for now, but I just need to add a few details to finish this.~~

~~When I do, I'll plan to release this in pypi.~~
